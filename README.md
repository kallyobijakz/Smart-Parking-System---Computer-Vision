## Overview
Urbanization and the rising number of vehicles have led to increased demand for efficient parking solutions. Traditional parking systems face challenges such as unauthorized access, inefficient space usage, lengthy wait times, and security issues. To address these, we are developing a Smart Parking System that integrates advanced computer vision and QR code technologies to streamline parking operations. This system is designed to automate the entry and exit processes, enhance security, and improve the overall user experience.

## Objectives
1. Automated Access Control
Utilize computer vision to recognize vehicle license plates, validating access for authorized vehicles.
Implement QR code scanning for quick entry and exit, reducing wait times and unauthorized access.
2. Efficient Space Management
Track real-time parking space availability to guide drivers to open spots, optimizing space utilization.
Enable centralized monitoring of parking spots to maximize occupancy and prevent unauthorized parking.
3. Enhanced Security
Integrate security measures that log and monitor vehicle entries and exits, with real-time alerts for suspicious activity.
Store and manage entry/exit data securely for audit and monitoring purposes.

## Key Features
Computer Vision for License Plate Recognition (LPR): Identify and validate authorized vehicles for seamless access.
QR Code Scanning: Allow users with authorized QR codes to quickly enter and exit the parking lot.
Real-Time Parking Management: Display available spots, enabling efficient parking allocation and reducing time spent searching.
Security Monitoring and Alerts: Track unauthorized access attempts and provide real-time notifications to security personnel.

## Technologies Used
Computer Vision: License plate recognition for access validation and security monitoring.
QR Code Technology: Quick and secure scanning for authorized entry and exit.
Database: Secure storage of parking data, logs, and access records.
User Interface: Driver dashboard with real-time updates on available parking spaces.

## Benefits
Enhanced Efficiency: Automates access, reducing wait times and improving traffic flow within the parking area.
Improved Security: Provides robust security checks, logging entries and flagging suspicious activities.
Better User Experience: Guides drivers to available spots, minimizing time spent searching for parking.

## Future Enhancements
Mobile Application Integration: Allow users to check parking availability remotely.
Dynamic Pricing: Adjust rates based on demand to optimize revenue.
Predictive Analytics: Use historical data to forecast peak parking times and optimize staffing.


## Conclusion
This Smart Parking System is designed to address the challenges of traditional parking methods through innovative use of computer vision and QR code technology. The solution provides a secure, efficient, and user-friendly experience that caters to both drivers and parking administrators, contributing to a modern and smart urban infrastructure.
